# Postcodes

Postcodes is a small library for getting information about, postcodes 
in the UK. At its core, the postcode data is provided by the 
[Ordnance Survey OS OpenData](http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/oswebsite/products/os-opendata.html) initiative, but this library is actually a
wrapper for a [web-service](http://www.uk-postcodes.com/) provided by [Stuart Harrison](http://twitter.com/pezholio).


## Installation

If you use pip then installation is simply:

    $ pip install postcodes

or, if you want the latest github version:

    $ pip install git+git://github.com/e-dard/postcodes.git

You can also install Postcodes via Easy Install:

    $ easy_install postcodes

    
## Features

Postcodes allows you to do the following:

 * Lookup the postcode data associated with a specific postcode;
 * Get the nearest postcode data associated to a specific geographical 
  point;
 * Get all of the postcode data within a specific distance to a 
  geographical point;
 * Get all of the postcode data within a specific distance to a 
  known postcode.

As well as being a thin wrapper over the [uk-postcodes](http://www.uk-postcodes.com/) [web-service](http://www.uk-postcodes.com/api.php), 
Postcodes also provides a simple caching and validation layer, in the 
form of the `PostCoder` object, meaning you don't have to worry about 
keeping track of any previously requested data.


## Usage

Postcodes is very simple. Simply create a new `PostCoder` object and 
away you go:

``` python
>>> from pprint import PrettyPrinter
>>> from postcodes import PostCoder
>>>
>>> pc = PostCoder()
>>> result = pc.get("SW1A 2TT")
>>> PrettyPrinter(indent=4).pprint(result['geo'])
{   u'easting': u'530283',
    u'geohash': u'http://geohash.org/gcpuvptqwyh4',
    u'lat': u'51.502308',
    u'lng': u'-0.124331',
    u'northing': u'179820'}
>>>
```

If for any reason you want to use your own caching or validation, you 
also have access to the functions in the `postcodes` module.

## Returned Data

For each postcode, a Python dictionary is returned containing all the 
available data from the Ordanance Survey Code-Point Open dataset. 
For example, ``postcodes.get("W1A 2TT")`` returns:

    { u'administrative': { u'constituency': { u'code': u'',
                                              u'title': u'',
                                              u'uri': u''},
                           u'district': { u'snac': u'',
                                          u'title': u'',
                                          u'uri': u''},
                           u'ward': { u'snac': u'',
                                      u'title': u'',
                                      u'uri': u''}},
      u'geo': { u'easting': u'',
                u'geohash': u'',
                u'lat': u'',
                u'lng': u'',
                u'northing': u''},
      u'postcode': u''}

Values have been removed for brevity.
